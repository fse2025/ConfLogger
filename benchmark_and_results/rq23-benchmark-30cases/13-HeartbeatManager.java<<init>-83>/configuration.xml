  <value>100</value>
  <description>
    This time decides the interval to check for expired datanodes.
    With this value and dfs.heartbeat.interval, the interval of
    deciding the datanode is stale or not is also calculated.
    The unit of this configuration is millisecond.

<property>
  <name>dfs.namenode.stale.datanode.interval</name>
  <value>1000</value>
  <description>
    Default time interval in milliseconds for marking a datanode as "stale",
    i.e., if the namenode has not received heartbeat msg from a datanode for
    more than this time interval, the datanode will be marked and treated 
    as "stale" by default. The stale interval cannot be too small since 
    otherwise this may cause too frequent change of stale states. 
    We thus set a minimum stale interval value (the default value is 3 times 
    of heartbeat interval) and guarantee that the stale interval cannot be less
    than the minimum value. A stale data node is avoided during lease/block
    recovery. It can be conditionally avoided for reads (see
    dfs.namenode.avoid.read.stale.datanode) and for writes (see
    dfs.namenode.avoid.write.stale.datanode).

<property>
  <name>dfs.namenode.avoid.write.stale.datanode</name>
  <value>true</value>
  <description>
    Indicate whether or not to avoid writing to &quot;stale&quot; datanodes whose 
    heartbeat messages have not been received by the namenode 
    for more than a specified time interval. Writes will avoid using 
    stale datanodes unless more than a configured ratio 
    (dfs.namenode.write.stale.datanode.ratio) of datanodes are marked as 
    stale. See dfs.namenode.avoid.read.stale.datanode for a similar setting
    for reads.
