    <description>
      Timeout to wait for each shutdown operation to complete.
      If a hook takes longer than this time to complete, it will be interrupted,
      so the service will shutdown. This allows the service shutdown
      to recover from a blocked operation.
      Some shutdown hooks may need more time than this, for example when
      a large amount of data needs to be uploaded to an object store.
      In this situation: increase the timeout.

      The minimum duration of the timeout is 1 second, "1s".
