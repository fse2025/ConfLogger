                        * To avoid the duplication of codes, we create a method called followingBehavior which was used to
                        * shared by FOLLOWING and LEADING. This method returns a Vote. When the returned Vote is null, it follows

                        * is generated.
                        *
                        * The reason why we need to separate these behaviors is to make the algorithm runnable for 2-node
                        * setting. An extra condition for generating leader is needed. Due to the majority rule, only when
                        * there is a majority in the voteset, a leader will be generated. However, in a configuration of 2 nodes,
                        * the number to achieve the majority remains 2, which means a recovered node cannot generate a leader which is
                        * the existed leader. Therefore, we need the Oracle to kick in this situation. In a two-node configuration, the Oracle
                        * only grants the permission to maintain the progress to one node. The oracle either grants the permission to the
                        * remained node and makes it a new leader when there is a faulty machine, which is the case to maintain the progress.
                        * Otherwise, the oracle does not grant the permission to the remained node, which further causes a service down.
                        *
                        * In the former case, when a failed server recovers and participate in the leader election, it would not locate a
                        * new leader because there does not exist a majority in the voteset. It fails on the containAllQuorum() infinitely due to
                        * two facts. First one is the fact that it does do not have a majority in the voteset. The other fact is the fact that
                        * the oracle would not give the permission since the oracle already gave the permission to the existed leader, the healthy machine.
                        * Logically, when the oracle replies with negative, it implies the existed leader which is LEADING notification comes from is a valid leader.
                        * To threat this negative replies as a permission to generate the leader is the purpose to separate these two behaviors.
