### Explanation:

1. **Task 1: Inspect Existing Outputs**
   - The existing warning log in the first `<code-specified>` block is skipped because it already provides configuration-related information about why the metrics logging will not be async. It mentions the logger type, which is relevant to the configuration.

2. **Task 2: Determine Log Insertion Position and Generate Logging Code**
   - **First `<code-specified>` block**: This block checks if the `metricsLog` is an instance of `Log4JLogger`. Since the existing log is sufficient, no additional logging is needed here.
   - **Second `<code-specified>` block**: This block configures the logger to use an `AsyncAppender` if it is not already configured. 
     - A log statement is inserted before the loop to indicate that the system is configuring the async appender and ensuring all previously configured appenders are included.
     - An additional log statement is added in the `else` block to indicate that no changes were made because the logger is already configured with an `AsyncAppender` or no appenders were found. This provides clarity on the control flow and configuration state.
