```java
/* make sure we clean the staging files */
String jobTempDir = getConfig().get(MRJobConfig.MAPREDUCE_JOB_DIR);
FileSystem fs = getFileSystem(getConfig());
try {
    if (!keepJobFiles(new JobConf(getConfig()), jobTempDir)) {
        if (jobTempDir == null) {
            // ConfLogger Skipped: The log message already indicates that the Job Staging directory is null, which is a configuration-related condition.
            LOG.warn("Job Staging directory is null");
            return;
        }
        Path jobTempDirPath = new Path(jobTempDir);
        // ConfLogger Skipped: The log message already indicates the action of deleting the staging directory, which is related to the configuration parameter.
        LOG.info("Deleting staging directory " + FileSystem.getDefaultUri(getConfig()) + " " + jobTempDir);
        fs.delete(jobTempDirPath, true);
    }
} catch(IOException io) {
    // ConfLogger Skipped: The log message already indicates the failure to cleanup the staging directory, which is related to the configuration parameter.
    LOG.error("Failed to cleanup staging dir " + jobTempDir, io);
}
```

In this code snippet, the existing log messages already provide sufficient information about the configuration-related conditions and actions. Therefore, no additional logging code is needed. The existing logs are skipped as they already fulfill the requirements of exposing configuration-related execution information.
