    Setting this value to a lower value implies that server crashes

    is managed by the ZooKeeper cluster itself, not by the client. This value is
    used by the cluster to determine when the client's session expires.
    Expirations happens when the cluster does not hear from the client within
    the specified session timeout period (i.e. no heartbeat)."
