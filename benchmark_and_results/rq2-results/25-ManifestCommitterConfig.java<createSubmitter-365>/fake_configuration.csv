2,fs.s3a.executor.capacity,16,"The maximum number of submitted tasks which is a single
    operation (e.g. rename(), delete()) may submit simultaneously for
    execution -excluding the IO-heavy block uploads, whose capacity
    is set in ""fs.s3a.fast.upload.active.blocks""

    All tasks are submitted to the shared thread pool whose size is
    set in ""fs.s3a.threads.max""; the value of capacity should be less than that
    of the thread pool itself, as the goal is to stop a single operation
    from overloading that thread pool."

      only some request parameters that are: block, blockToken, clientName, startOffset, len, verifyChecksum,

      signature exceeds the maximum allowed bytes in server, the caller context
      will be abandoned, in which case the caller context will not be recorded
      in audit logs."

    io warning in a dfsclient. By default, this parameter is set to 30000
    milliseconds (30 seconds)."
8,hadoop.security.groups.negative-cache.secs,30,"Expiration time for entries in the the negative user-to-group mapping
    caching, in seconds. This is useful when invalid users are retrying
    frequently. It is suggested to set a small value for this expiration, since
    a transient error in group lookup could temporarily lock out a legitimate
    user.

    Set this to zero or negative value to disable negative user-to-group caching."
