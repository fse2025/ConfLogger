name:hadoop.nfs.userupdate.milly
value:1*1000
relevant log:1-WARN	User configured user account update time is less than 1 minute. Using default minimum of 1 minute instead. Please ensure usergroupid.update.millis is set to at least 60000 milliseconds.
explanation:The log indicates that the user account update time is less than 1 minute, which is not allowed. The system uses a default minimum of 1 minute instead. The configuration option 'hadoop.nfs.userupdate.milly' is set to 1*1000 milliseconds, which is less than the required minimum of 60000 milliseconds. This is likely the root cause of the warning in the log. 

name:dfs.client.failover.connection.retries
value:0
relevant log:<missing>
explanation:Although there is no direct log entry related to this configuration, the value of 'dfs.client.failover.connection.retries' is set to 0. This means that the system will not attempt to re-establish a server connection in case of a failover. This could potentially lead to system instability or failure, especially in a distributed environment like Hadoop.
