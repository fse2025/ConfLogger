hadoop.nfs.userupdate.milly,1*1000,1-WARN	User configured user account update time is less than 1 minute. Using default minimum of 1 minute instead. Please ensure usergroupid.update.millis is set to at least 60000 milliseconds.,"The log indicates that the user account update time is less than 1 minute, which is not allowed. The system uses a default minimum of 1 minute instead. The configuration option 'hadoop.nfs.userupdate.milly' is set to 1*1000 milliseconds, which is less than the required minimum of 60000 milliseconds. This is likely the root cause of the warning in the log."
dfs.client.failover.connection.retries,0,<missing>,"Although there is no direct log entry related to this configuration, the value of 'dfs.client.failover.connection.retries' is set to 0. This means that the system will not attempt to re-establish a server connection in case of a failover. This could potentially lead to system instability or failure, especially in a distributed environment like Hadoop."
yarn.nodemanager.runtime.linux.runc.layer-mounts-to-keep,100,<missing>,"There is no direct log entry related to this configuration. However, the description of this configuration is missing, which could potentially lead to misconfiguration or misunderstanding of its purpose. This could potentially cause issues in the system."
