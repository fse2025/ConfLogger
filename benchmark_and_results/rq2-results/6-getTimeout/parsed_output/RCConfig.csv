ipc.client.rpc-timeout.ms,-100,1-INFO	IPC client ping is disabled. Configuration parameter 'ipc.client.ping' is set to false. Using ping interval as timeout.,"The log indicates that the 'ipc.client.ping' is set to false, which means the 'ipc.client.rpc-timeout.ms' is used as the timeout. However, the value of 'ipc.client.rpc-timeout.ms' is set to -100, which is an invalid value for a timeout. This could be the root cause of the anomaly."
ipc.client.rpc-timeout.ms,<missing>,1-INFO	IPC client ping is disabled. Configuration parameter 'ipc.client.ping' is set to false. Using ping interval as timeout.,"The log indicates that the 'ipc.client.ping' is set to false, which means the 'ipc.client.rpc-timeout.ms' is used as the timeout. However, the value of 'ipc.client.rpc-timeout.ms' is missing, which could cause errors as the system does not know how long to wait for a response from the server."

Using ping interval as timeout.,"The log indicates that the 'ipc.client.ping' is set to false, which means the 'ha.failover-controller.cli-check.rpc-timeout.ms' could be used as the timeout. However, the value of 'ha.failover-controller.cli-check.rpc-timeout.ms' is set to 20000, which might be too long and cause delays in the system."
