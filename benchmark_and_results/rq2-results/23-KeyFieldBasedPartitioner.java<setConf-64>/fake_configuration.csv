1,dfs.datanode.fileio.profiling.sampling.percentage,0,"This setting controls the percentage of file I/O events which will be
    profiled for DataNode disk statistics. The default value of 0 disables
    disk statistics. Set to an integer value between 1 and 100 to enable disk
    statistics."
2,dfs.client.read.shortcircuit.streams.cache.size,256,"The DFSClient maintains a cache of recently opened file descriptors.
    This parameter controls the maximum number of file descriptors in the cache.
    Setting this higher will use more file descriptors,
    but potentially provide better performance on workloads
    involving lots of seeks."
3,dfs.namenode.fs-limits.max-component-length,255,"Defines the maximum number of bytes in UTF-8 encoding in each
      component of a path.  A value of 0 will disable the check. Support
      multiple size unit suffix(case insensitive), as described in dfs.blocksize."
4,dfs.datanode.fsdatasetcache.max.threads.per.volume,4,"The maximum number of threads per volume to use for caching new data
    on the datanode. These threads consume both I/O and CPU. This can affect
    normal datanode operations."

8,hadoop.security.group.mapping.ldap.read.timeout.ms,60000,"This property is the read timeout (in milliseconds) for LDAP
    operations. If the LDAP provider doesn't get a LDAP response within the
    specified period, it will abort the read attempt. Non-positive value
    means no read timeout is specified in which case it waits for the response
    infinitely."
9,mapreduce.job.speculative.retry-after-speculate,15000,"The waiting time(ms) to do next round of speculation
  if there are tasks speculated in this round."
