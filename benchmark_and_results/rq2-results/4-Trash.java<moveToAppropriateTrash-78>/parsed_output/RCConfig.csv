fs.viewfs.trash.force-inside-mount-point,<missing>,"1-INFO	Localized trash flag is not enabled. Initializing Trash with fully resolved FileSystem object. Configuration parameter: CONFIG_VIEWFS_TRASH_FORCE_INSIDE_MOUNT_POINT, Value: false","The log indicates that the trash flag is not enabled and the configuration parameter CONFIG_VIEWFS_TRASH_FORCE_INSIDE_MOUNT_POINT is set to false. However, the configuration option 'fs.viewfs.trash.force-inside-mount-point' is missing a value. This could be the root cause of the issue as the system might be trying to initialize the Trash with a fully resolved FileSystem object but fails due to the missing configuration value."
